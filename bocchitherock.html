    <div class="description">


Hitori Gotou, nicknamed “Bocchi-chan,” is very introverted and shy.
She often struggles to start conversations, usually saying just “Ah…”
During middle school, she began playing the guitar.
Her dream was to join a band and finally shine.
But she had no friends to play with.
So, she practiced alone for six hours every day.
Over time, she became an excellent guitarist.
She uploaded her performances online as “Guitar Hero.”
Bocchi fantasized about performing at her school’s festival.
However, she couldn’t find bandmates to make it real.
High school came, but she still had no friends.
She was nearly becoming a shut-in.
One day, drummer Nijika Ijichi noticed her.
Joining Kessoku Band slowly began to change her life.
